# Focus: An exceedingly simple Vim color scheme.

Syntax highlighting is mostly unnecessary. It is only necessary to quickly distinguish comments. Removing every other color is unnecessary. Most highlight groups are rarely used. This color scheme does the necessary. The bare minimum.

This color scheme can be installed with [`vim-plug`][1].

    call plug#begin()
    Plug 'pedrominicz/focus'
    call plug#end()
